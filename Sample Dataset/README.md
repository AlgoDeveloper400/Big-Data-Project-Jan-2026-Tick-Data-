This is a tiny sample from the datalake house, I believe it was partitioned by year from my last test run, you can use this data file if you wish to test this pipeline, please note that its only for 1 symbol, so you will need to configure the symbols_list.json file to avoid errors. Its a small parquet file, it computes the basic statistics of the file based on the yearly partition, so when load the data, just keep that in mind, to avoid any schema related issues.
