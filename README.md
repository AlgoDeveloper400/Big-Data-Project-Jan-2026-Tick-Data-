![Tick Data ML Trading Pipeline](./Tick%20Data%20ML%20Trading%20Pipeline%20JAN%20TO%20FEB%202026.png)

> 🚧 **Status:** Active development
>
> ⚠️ **Important Notice**: This pipeline is **iterative and likely to change**. Components, data flow, tools, and deployment strategies may evolve as performance, scalability, and research requirements change. This README reflects the **current intended architecture**, not a final or frozen design.

---

## 1. 🧠 High‑Level Overview

This pipeline is an **end‑to‑end quantitative trading ML system** designed to:

* 📥 Ingest **high‑frequency tick data**
* ⚙️ Perform scalable **data processing & feature preparation**
* 🤖 Train, validate, and test **pattern‑based ML models**
* 🧪 Track experiments and models
* 🚀 Deploy trained models to **demo trading execution (MT5)**

The architecture follows **ML‑Ops best practices**, separating concerns across:

* 📡 Data ingestion
* 🧹 Data processing
* 🔁 Model lifecycle (train → validate → test)
* 📊 Experiment tracking
* 🧩 Deployment
* 👀 Monitoring & orchestration

---

## 2. 🌍 Data Source Layer

### 2.1 Dukascopy Tick Data

* **Source**: Dukascopy historical tick data
* **Data Type**: Raw tick‑level price data
* **Granularity**: Extremely high frequency (sub‑second)

**Responsibilities**:

* 🧾 Provide raw, unprocessed market data
* 🧱 Act as the immutable source of truth

---

## 3. 🗄️ Raw Data Storage

### 3.1 Raw CSV Storage

* Raw tick data is downloaded and stored as **CSV files**
* No transformations are applied at this stage

**Why this matters**:

* ♻️ Preserves original data for reproducibility
* 🔄 Allows reprocessing with different logic later
* 🛡️ Acts as a recovery point if downstream stages fail

---

## 4. ⚙️ Data Processing Layer

### 4.1 Spark‑Based Processing

**Tooling**:

* ⚡ Apache Spark

**Steps**:

1. 📥 Ingest raw CSV files
2. 🔄 Convert CSV → Parquet (columnar, efficient)
3. 🧮 Perform large‑scale transformations

**Why Spark**:

* 🚄 Handles massive tick datasets efficiently
* 🧵 Parallel computation
* 🧠 Memory‑efficient transformations

---

### 4.2 Cleaning & Imputation

**Responsibilities**:

* 🩹 Handle missing ticks
* 🗑️ Remove corrupt or invalid rows
* ⏱️ Normalize timestamps
* 📐 Prepare consistent numerical features

**Output**:

* ✅ Cleaned, structured datasets ready for ML consumption

---

## 5. 🔀 Orchestration & Monitoring

### 5.1 Apache NiFi

NiFi is used for **pipeline orchestration and monitoring**.

**Roles**:

* 👁️ Monitor data ingestion
* 🔗 Track data movement between stages
* 🚨 Detect failures and bottlenecks
* 🛠️ Ensure reliability of long‑running flows

NiFi does **not train models** — it ensures data flows correctly and consistently.

---

### 5.2 Version Control

* 🗂️ All code, configs, and pipeline definitions are version‑controlled
* ↩️ Ensures reproducibility and rollback capability

---

## 6. 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

### 6.1 Pattern Model Core

At the center of the ML pipeline is the **Pattern Model**, which:

* 📊 Consumes processed tick data
* 🔍 Extracts patterns or signals
* 🧠 Learns predictive structures from historical behavior

This model is **continuously improved** through retraining.

---

### 6.2 Training Phase

* 📚 Uses historical processed data
* 🎯 Learns parameters and decision boundaries
* 📦 Outputs trained model artifacts

---

### 6.3 Validation Phase

* 🧪 Evaluates performance on unseen validation data
* 🛑 Prevents overfitting
* ✅ Determines model readiness

---

### 6.4 Testing Phase

* 🧪 Final evaluation on fully isolated test data
* 🌐 Simulates real‑world behavior as closely as possible

Only models that pass **all three stages** are eligible for deployment.

---

### 6.5 Live Endpoint API

* 🌐 Exposes the trained model via an API
* 📡 Accepts live or near‑real‑time market data
* 📤 Outputs trading signals

This endpoint is consumed by the deployment layer.

---

## 7. 🧪 Experiment & Model Tracking

### 7.1 MLflow

**Purpose**:

* 🧾 Track experiments
* 📈 Log metrics
* 📦 Store model artifacts
* 🔍 Compare model versions

**Benefits**:

* 🕵️ Full audit trail of experiments
* ↩️ Easy rollback to previous models
* 🆚 Transparent performance comparison

---

## 8. 🚀 Deployment Layer

### 8.1 MT5 Deployment

* 📤 Trained models are deployed to **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)**
* 🔄 Signals are streamed from the ML API to MT5

---

### 8.2 Live / Demo Trade Execution

* ⚡ Signals trigger automated trade execution
* Can operate in:

  * 🧪 Demo mode (testing)
  * 🧪 Backtests (testing)

Execution logic is intentionally **separated** from model logic.

---

## 9. 🔁 Monitoring & Feedback Loops

* 📡 Every major stage emits monitoring signals
* 🔄 Performance feedback can be used to:

  * 🔁 Retrain models
  * 🧹 Adjust preprocessing logic
  * 🎛️ Tune execution strategies

This creates a **closed feedback loop** between live trading and research.

---

## 10. 🧩 Design Principles

This pipeline is built around:

* ♻️ **Reproducibility** – raw data preserved
* 📈 **Scalability** – Spark & distributed processing
* 🧱 **Separation of concerns** – data, ML, execution isolated
* 👀 **Observability** – monitoring at every stage
* 🔧 **Flexibility** – components can be swapped or upgraded

---

## 11. ⚠️ Change Disclaimer

⚠️ **This architecture is not static**.

Expected future changes may include:

* 🌍 Different data sources
* 🧠 Alternative feature engineering
* 🤖 Model architecture upgrades
* 🛡️ Additional risk management layers
* 🚀 Improved deployment strategies

Any diagram or description should be treated as a **snapshot in time**, not a final contract.

---

## 12. 🏁 Summary

This pipeline represents a **professional‑grade ML trading system**, designed to handle:

* ⏱️ High‑frequency financial data
* 🧪 Robust ML experimentation
* 🚀 Controlled live deployment

It balances **research flexibility** with **production discipline**, making it suitable for continuous improvement and real‑world trading use.
