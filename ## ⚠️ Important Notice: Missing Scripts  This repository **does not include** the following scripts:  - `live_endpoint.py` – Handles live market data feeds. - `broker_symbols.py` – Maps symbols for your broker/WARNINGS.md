# ⚠️ Missing Scripts

The following scripts are **not included**:

1. `live_endpoint.py`
2. `broker_symbols.py`

> These scripts are platform-specific. You need to implement them according to your trading broker or API.  
> The repository is designed to be flexible and can work with multiple brokers, so the implementation will vary.
